            There hasn't been any activity on this issue recently. In an effort
            to provide a better overview of current issues we automatically clean
            some of the old ones. Many of them may already be resolved in newer
            versions of room-assistant.

            This issue has now been marked as stale and will be closed if no further
            activity occurs. Thank you for your contributions.
