It does this by sending out connection requests to the device addresses you configure on rotation and then checking the signal strength of the response. The configured Bluetooth devices do not need to be paired with your machines running room-assistant.</p><p>The integration has been tested to work great with the Apple Watch. You may see a minor hit on the battery life of the Bluetooth devices when enabling this.</p><h2 id="requirements" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#requirements" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Requirements</h2><h3 id="running-with-nodejs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#running-with-nodejs" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Running with NodeJS</h3><p>This integration only works on Linux, as it depends on <code>hcitool</code>.

Every 6 seconds each instance in the cluster will be tasked with querying the signal strength of one of the configured devices. The resulting RSSI values are shared with all other instances, one of which keeps track of all device states.</p><p>Each configured device will create a sensor that has the name of the closest room-assistant instance as its state - or <code>not_home</code> if the device could not be found by any of them. The distance in the attributes of those sensors is the inverted signal strength value and does not actually represent any physical distance. It may also show negative numbers.</p><h2 id="inquiries-switch" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#inquiries-switch" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Inquiries switch</h2><p>Each instance running this integration will also create a switch for enabling or disabling Bluetooth inquiries. A disabled switch blocks all Bluetooth requests of the instance, which essentially means that your Bluetooth device won&#39;t be discovered by this instance anymore. It does not take the instance out of the rotation however, so the time to detection stays the same.</p><p>You could use this to reduce the resources used by room-assistant when you are certain nobody is home. Another example would be disabling the inquiries when you are asleep to save the batteries of your Bluetooth devices at night.</p><p>You can also use this feature to only trigger scans when you are certain that some change has happened, e.g. whenever a motion sensor was triggered. In that case you would need to enable the <code>preserveState</code> setting to still get accurate results after turning the switch off again. Note that room-assistant internally sends out pseudo updates in that case, so the timestamps will update in the API even though no scans are happening.</p><h2 id="troubleshooting" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#troubleshooting" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Troubleshooting</h2><h3 id="random-incorrect-not-home-states" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#random-incorrect-not-home-states" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Random incorrect not_home states</h3><p>This happens when no measurements were collected for the device recently. To make the timeout a bit more lax and get rid of these incorrect states you can raise the <code>timeoutCycles</code> value. Note that this will also delay your device being reported as <code>not_home</code> when it really has gone away.</p><h3 id="wifi-bluetooth-interference" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#wifi-bluetooth-interference" aria-hidden="true">#</a> WiFi/Bluetooth interference</h3><p>Bluetooth uses the 2.4 GHz band, which may also be used by some of your other WiFi devices. This can cause interferences. Some Bluetooth devices may also handle a too aggressive refresh interval badly. If you are noticing any issues (e.g. WiFi devices dropping off the network, Bluetooth headphones disconnecting randomly) try raising the <code>interval</code> a bit. Note that this will also make the state updates a bit slower.</p><h3 id="slow-unresponsive-device-over-ssh" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#slow-unresponsive-device-over-ssh" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Slow/unresponsive device over SSH</h3><p>On some Single Board computers, such as the Raspberry Pis with integrated Wifi/BT, Bluetooth and WiFi are on a shared chip and antenna. If Bluetooth communication is happening the chip will temporarily shutdown WiFi packets until it is done, then switch back. Only one protocol is active at the same time, which can lead to request timeouts and delays in packets: if the the device is pinged at the wrong time, it won&#39;t accept a connection, and thus will time out. It will also lead to sluggish SSH sessions occasionally.</p><p>Why? The command used for polling takes about 5.5s overall, most of which are Bluetooth communication. If all allowlisted devices are away the SBC essentially only has about 1s of the 6s interval available for WiFi communication. If devices are near the effects are much less noticeable, as the polling finishes quickly and unlocks the chip for WiFi communication.</p><p>If you don&#39;t have anything else running on the Pis this shouldn&#39;t be much of an issue - room-assistant can handle the harsh network conditions. If you want the Pis to be more responsive and/or run other applications on them, currently there is only one solution that will do the trick: increase the interval. Keep in mind this also slows down the detection a bit.</p>`,29),h={href:"https://github.com/mKeRix/room-assistant/issues/178",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},p=n("See here for the original issue context where this was discussed."),m=e("h3",{id:"apple-watch-not-being-detected",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#apple-watch-not-being-detected","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),n(" Apple Watch not being detected")],-1),b=e("p",null,"Try to pair your Apple Watch to a Bluetooth device such as headphones/speakers first, then add it to room-assistant for detection.
